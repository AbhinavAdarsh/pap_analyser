Part D Fairness (10 points)


(1) Multiplicative Increase Additive Decrease (MIAD): If MIAD is used, we can see from the graph that when loss occurs,
    it is decreased linearly and then increased rapidly. The graph shows that it is not fair as it is going away from
    the fairness line.

(2) Multiplicative Increase Multiplicative Decrease (MIMD): If MIMD is used, we can see from the graph that when loss
    occurs, it is decreased rapidly and then increased rapidly. The graph clearly shows that in such scenarios, the line
    goes away from the fairness line, thus unequal distribution. So, it is not fair.

(3) Additive Increase Additive Decrease (AIAD: If AIAD is used , we can see from the graph that when loss occurs, it is
    decreased linearly and then increased linearly. This results in the line staying in parallel with the fairness
    line. Therefore, again not fair distribution among the two runnig flows.
